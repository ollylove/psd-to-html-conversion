# psd-to-html-conversion
A simple psd to html conversion test for pixel2html team

This one-page website has been check on the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Explorer;

It's perfectly responsive and works correctly on iPhone 5, iPhone 6, Galaxy S5 and Nexus 5

I've been using SCSS compiler and both jQuery and vanilla javascript

I've also used Font Awesome for arrow- and tick-icons, because I think they are pretty, easy to use and work very well

Using Toggl app, I've monitorized my activity from the very beginning to the end, excluding the time used to push the test on github; 
in total I've been spending 5h and 58m (excluding a couple of breaks for a warming tea :) )

Thank you for this opportunity!!.. :)

Cheers,

Olly
